<h2>Some resourses to practice GLSL (OpenGL, WebGL)</h2>
<p>I found some resources to practice GLSL, and this is here:</p>
<p>1: <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">https://www.shadertoy.com/</a></p>
<p>I very much like this website because it includes many resources for texture and coding GLSL is easier.</p>
<p>2: <a href="https://glslsandbox.com/">https://glslsandbox.com/</a></p>
<p>It also provides us with nice shader collections, but I'm not satisfied with the shader editor, because it doesn't offer much. I hope you will find some shaders beautiful.</p>
